# Iris-Prediction-Model
This repository contains a neural network model built with PyTorch to classify iris flowers using Fisher's Iris dataset. The model has two hidden layers and predicts the iris species based on input features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Future updates will include image processing capabilities for data extraction.
